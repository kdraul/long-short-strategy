# Development of a Long-Short Equity Strategy out of the Relationships between the Stock Returns and the Financial Ratios or Growths
This project is a result of the combination of the assignments from the "Data-Driven Investing with Python | Financial Data Science" course from 'Fervent' on Udemy. The platform used for this project is the 'Jupyter Notebook' which is an integrated development environment (IDE) and a presentation tool for the Python programming language.
Several important libraries of Python like the NumPy, the pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn and the statsmodels, that are in extensive use today in the field of Data Science, were used for the analysis.
